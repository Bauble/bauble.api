            The name of the genus.  In addition to standard generic
            names any additional hybrid flags or genera should included here.

        *qualifier*:
            Designates the botanical status of the genus.

            Possible values:
                * s. lat.: aggregrate genus (sensu lato)

                * s. str.: segregate genus (sensu stricto)

        *author*:
            The name or abbreviation of the author who published this genus.

    :Properties:
        *family*:
            The family of the genus.

            a genus is listed as a synonym of this genus then this
            genus should be considered the current and valid name for
